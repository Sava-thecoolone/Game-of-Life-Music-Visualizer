7,10  x and y starting positions (from bottom-left corner)
......O.  the code from life lexicon without tabs (https://conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_d.htm#diehard)
OO......
.O...OOO

!!! WARNING !!!
you shouldn't put numbers in the first comment and you shouldn't put O's in the second! (everything in the code above works)
here's an example:
7,10  x's and y's starting positions are 7 and 10    <- this shouldn't work
......O.  here's a piece of COOL code i've made      <- this will (most likely) not work, this will work only if the O's are too far and out of the grid bounds
OO......
.O...OOO

also, you have to put the numbers first or it will crash
