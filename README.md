# Game of Life Music Visualizer 🎵🔊

## What's this?  
A tool that generates music from **Conway's Game of Life**.  
This is my second (and much improved) attempt to remake the tool from the video:  
["Conway's Game of Life as a Musical Instrument" by AlgoMotion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2SjVwYNr54).  

### New Features:  
- 🖱️ **Drag-and-drop pattern loading**  
- ⚡ **On-the-fly setting adjustments**  
- 🎛️ **Interactive GUI**  
- 🚀 **Optimized performance** (~500 FPS uncapped)
